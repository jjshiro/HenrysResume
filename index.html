                <h3>About my breed — rhodesian ridgeback x, Shar-pei, staffy x</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I get my golden glow and floppy ears from the Rhodesian Ridgeback. I have the wrinkles of a Shar-Pei, the smokey eyes of a Staffy, and the cuddling needs of a human.</li>
                    <li>I need daily exercise but I love a good sleep in too.</li>
                    <li>I am an affectionate and loving mix, so I love a good snuggle!</li>
                    <li>I am a devoted, loyal and affectionate companion. Protective of my owners and property, but I don’t bark unless there is something I’m concerned about or feel threatened by. Mum is working with me to desensitize bikes, scooters, and cats.</li>
                    <li>I’m a very intelligent pupper, I want to impress, I respond well to training, and can learn new games and tricks fast!</li>

                <p class="quote">"My mum keeps me really well groomed with regular pedicures, baths once a month, and if I have been for a muddy walk I get an outside bath. Every month I am given a flea treatment and twice a year a worming tablet, I’m very good at taking medicine. I have been to the vet a few times and behaved really well."</p>
